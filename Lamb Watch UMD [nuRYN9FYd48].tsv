0	4000	U-M-D Lamb Watch, where normal is a lamb in a bucket.
4000	8000	But let's start at the beginning.
8000	12000	Animal Science 245, Sheep Management,
12000	16000	a.k.a. Lamb Watch, transforms students into shepherds.
16000	20000	There's class, jugs, mucking the stalls, chalkboards, whiteboard, paperwork, heat lamps,
20000	24000	grain, hay, lots of hay, cows, horses, cats, and of course,
24000	26000	sheep.
26000	30000	13 U's deliver between 13 to 26 lambs during the course.
30000	33000	List has two lambs.
33000	37000	And give novice student shepherds a chance to apply their in-class lessons.
37000	42000	We help out with the first physical exams, looking at the respiratory rates,
42000	46000	the temperature of the U's and the lambs,
46000	49000	and the weight of the lambs.
52000	55000	Farm work is a 24-7 operation.
55000	59000	Rain, shine, or snow. And there is always something to do.
59000	62000	A few chores that we do have while working on the farm,
62000	66000	run into the water and take cleaning, sweeping, feeding,
66000	68000	and you have to be on top of everything.
68000	71000	Especially when watching over pregnant animals.
71000	73000	Yes, are you happy?
73000	75000	Yes, my love, yes.
75000	79000	The sheep, they're very friendly and it's so fun to be around sheep.
79000	82000	Are you hungry?
83000	87000	After birth, a leg bath, and bonding time with the U,
87000	90000	lambs need a thorough checkup from the student shepherds
90000	92000	to keep the flock healthy and happy.
92000	95000	Shepherds keep out infection by dunking umbilical cords
95000	98000	and hooves in iodine, and weigh the lambs
98000	101000	to ensure they are getting proper nutrition.
101000	104000	As more lambs join the herd, the farm pace speeds up.
104000	108000	Rub notes wait, feed clean hay, rub notes wait,
108000	111000	feed clean hay, rub notes wait.
111000	113000	Until all of the lambs are born,
113000	116000	and a flock of 13 at the beginning of February
116000	119000	has expanded to 39.
119000	122000	Landwatch and taking care of pregnant sheep
122000	124000	has been really fun and rewarding.
124000	127000	Being able to be a part of a birth and help out if needed,
127000	130000	even though we're students, I really do appreciate that.
130000	134000	So the most meaningful part about being in this sheep management class
134000	138000	is this is just not a quiz or an assignment.
138000	141000	These are lives that we're taking care of.
141000	143000	And that's very meaningful to me
143000	146000	because I get to see them grow up and develop
146000	148000	based on how much I take care of them,
148000	150000	how much I know of them from lectures.
150000	152000	The student shepherds will continue
152000	154000	with their farm responsibilities.
154000	158000	In the meantime, shhhhhh,
158000	161000	let's give the U's and lambs some time to rest.
168000	171000	Thank you.
