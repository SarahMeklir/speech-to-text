00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
U-M-D Lamb Watch, where normal is a lamb in a bucket.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
But let's start at the beginning.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Animal Science 245, Sheep Management,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
a.k.a. Lamb Watch, transforms students into shepherds.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
There's class, jugs, mucking the stalls, chalkboards, whiteboard, paperwork, heat lamps,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
grain, hay, lots of hay, cows, horses, cats, and of course,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
sheep.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
13 U's deliver between 13 to 26 lambs during the course.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
List has two lambs.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
And give novice student shepherds a chance to apply their in-class lessons.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
We help out with the first physical exams, looking at the respiratory rates,

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
the temperature of the U's and the lambs,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
and the weight of the lambs.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Farm work is a 24-7 operation.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Rain, shine, or snow. And there is always something to do.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
A few chores that we do have while working on the farm,

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
run into the water and take cleaning, sweeping, feeding,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
and you have to be on top of everything.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Especially when watching over pregnant animals.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes, are you happy?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes, my love, yes.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
The sheep, they're very friendly and it's so fun to be around sheep.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Are you hungry?

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
After birth, a leg bath, and bonding time with the U,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
lambs need a thorough checkup from the student shepherds

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
to keep the flock healthy and happy.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Shepherds keep out infection by dunking umbilical cords

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and hooves in iodine, and weigh the lambs

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
to ensure they are getting proper nutrition.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
As more lambs join the herd, the farm pace speeds up.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Rub notes wait, feed clean hay, rub notes wait,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
feed clean hay, rub notes wait.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Until all of the lambs are born,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
and a flock of 13 at the beginning of February

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
has expanded to 39.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Landwatch and taking care of pregnant sheep

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
has been really fun and rewarding.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Being able to be a part of a birth and help out if needed,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
even though we're students, I really do appreciate that.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
So the most meaningful part about being in this sheep management class

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
is this is just not a quiz or an assignment.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
These are lives that we're taking care of.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And that's very meaningful to me

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
because I get to see them grow up and develop

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
based on how much I take care of them,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
how much I know of them from lectures.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
The student shepherds will continue

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
with their farm responsibilities.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
In the meantime, shhhhhh,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
let's give the U's and lambs some time to rest.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Thank you.
