Here are my expansive thoughts. 

It did a very good job! In the (02:32.000 --> 02:34.000) timestamp, it even wrote six "h"s in "shhhhhh" to show the person held out the "sh" sound longer. Very cool! However, it also called "ewes" "U's" instead, which contextualy seems like a silly mistake to make in a sheep video. There are a ton of uses for this! We were constantly running into problems with youtube videos in my old newsroom, and a way to download them would have been very helpful.
