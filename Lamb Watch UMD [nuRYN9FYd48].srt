1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
U-M-D Lamb Watch, where normal is a lamb in a bucket.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But let's start at the beginning.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Animal Science 245, Sheep Management,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a.k.a. Lamb Watch, transforms students into shepherds.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There's class, jugs, mucking the stalls, chalkboards, whiteboard, paperwork, heat lamps,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
grain, hay, lots of hay, cows, horses, cats, and of course,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
sheep.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
13 U's deliver between 13 to 26 lambs during the course.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
List has two lambs.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And give novice student shepherds a chance to apply their in-class lessons.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We help out with the first physical exams, looking at the respiratory rates,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the temperature of the U's and the lambs,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the weight of the lambs.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Farm work is a 24-7 operation.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Rain, shine, or snow. And there is always something to do.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A few chores that we do have while working on the farm,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
run into the water and take cleaning, sweeping, feeding,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and you have to be on top of everything.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Especially when watching over pregnant animals.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, are you happy?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, my love, yes.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The sheep, they're very friendly and it's so fun to be around sheep.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are you hungry?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After birth, a leg bath, and bonding time with the U,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
lambs need a thorough checkup from the student shepherds

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to keep the flock healthy and happy.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Shepherds keep out infection by dunking umbilical cords

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and hooves in iodine, and weigh the lambs

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to ensure they are getting proper nutrition.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
As more lambs join the herd, the farm pace speeds up.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Rub notes wait, feed clean hay, rub notes wait,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
feed clean hay, rub notes wait.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Until all of the lambs are born,

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and a flock of 13 at the beginning of February

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
has expanded to 39.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Landwatch and taking care of pregnant sheep

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
has been really fun and rewarding.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Being able to be a part of a birth and help out if needed,

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
even though we're students, I really do appreciate that.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So the most meaningful part about being in this sheep management class

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is this is just not a quiz or an assignment.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
These are lives that we're taking care of.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that's very meaningful to me

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
because I get to see them grow up and develop

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
based on how much I take care of them,

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
how much I know of them from lectures.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The student shepherds will continue

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
with their farm responsibilities.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In the meantime, shhhhhh,

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
let's give the U's and lambs some time to rest.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you.
